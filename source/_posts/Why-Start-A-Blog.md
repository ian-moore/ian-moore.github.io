I have entertained the idea of writing and maintaining a coding blog every so often. For the first time, I feel ready to start one. Here is what I'd like to write about and achieve through this blog:

1. **Personal knowledge repository** - Most importantly, I need a place to keep track of ideas, designs, opinions, or news I find valuable. I anticipate that many posts may simply be notes on other content. I tend to be very invested in ideas for a very short period of time - hopefully having a written record of what I've been reading or working on will provide some value for the time I spend on these never-finished projects.

2. **Sharing Good Code** - While I have only been a "professional" developer for a few years... I feel like I have written a lot of bad code, and I don't like it. I would love to prevent others from making the same mistakes as me. If there are good coding ideas I find elsewhere, or (probably very rarely) come up with myself - I want to share and promote those ideas.

3. **Other Thoughts** - I may occasionally write about other things I am interested in. If I write about it, maybe I won't waste as much time thinking about it in the future.
